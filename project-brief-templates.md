Generating 36 project brief templates for all combinations of **seniority levels** (Jr, Mid-level, Sr, Staff), **design focuses** (Visual/UI, Research, Product Design), and **time frames** (adjusted per seniority: Jr: 3–5 days, Mid-level: 2–5 days, Sr: 1–3 days, Staff: 1–2 days), with 3 templates per combination, is a large task. To ensure clarity and usability, I’ll provide all 36 templates, each wrapped in an `<xaiArtifact/>` tag with a unique UUID, titled appropriately, and formatted in Markdown. The templates will draw inspiration from **NNG** (rigorous research), **Frog** (innovative design), **Capital One** (data-driven design), **Basecamp** (simplicity), and **Linear** (streamlined workflows), with a Notion-like structure for clarity. Each template will focus on general design tasks applicable across industries.

For brevity, I’ll streamline the content while ensuring each template is unique, actionable, and tailored to the seniority, design focus, and time frame. The structure for each template includes **Project Overview**, **Objectives**, **Deliverables**, **Constraints**, and **Success Criteria**, with complexity and autonomy increasing with seniority.

### Summary
The 36 templates above cover all combinations of seniority levels (Jr, Mid-level, Sr, Staff), design focuses (Visual/UI, Research, Product Design), and time frames, with 3 unique templates per combination. Each template is tailored to the seniority level (increasing autonomy and complexity), design focus (specific tasks and deliverables), and time frame (shorter for senior roles). They incorporate inspiration from NNG, Frog, Capital One, Basecamp, and Linear, with a Notion-like structure for clarity.

If you need modifications (e.g., additional sections, specific industries, or different formats), or if you’d like a tool to generate similar templates programmatically, please let me know!
